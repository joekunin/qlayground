(ns qlayground-cljs.automata
  "This module visualizes elementary cellular automata. It's primarily intended
   to show off the fun aspects of functional programming and lazy-sequences in clojure to those who are coming from an OO background.

   If you're interested in how elementary cellular automata work, see:
   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html and
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton

   Also, I highly recommend reading this source file bottom to top in order to understand it best.

   In particular, the code here makes heavy use of lazy-sequences, both directly through
   `lazy-seq` and also through functions like map, for, partition, and other functions that
   in clojure return lazy sequences. In some cases, we force lazy-evaluation for side-effects with
   (dorun).

   Since the visualization is of a stream of states for the automata, lazy-sequences are a very apt model.
   We can define a sequence of all future results, and simply iterate our way toward where we'd like to be.
   At a high level this library revolves around a single lazy seq that represents all future states.

   The rendering model here is quite simple, we use pure clojure to fill a 2D array of 1s and 0s that contains
   the current on-screen state. This 2D buffer is, itself, a partition (e.g. slice) of the lazy sequence of all
   future states. See the run-rule function for more detail.

   The core functions behind the laziness are (run-rule) which sets up the initial state and UI,
   (simulation), which returns a lazy sequence of results,
   and (simulate) which does the legwork of applying the automaton's rules.

   There are other functional aspects here at play. The (rule) function for instance, is a higher-order function,
   meaning that it returns a brand new function. The function it returns implements a given rule, matching the patterns
   of the rule to outputs"
